# Customer Lifetime Value Project

## Introduction

This project involves creating models that calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). We go through the entire data analysis process, from preprocessing raw data, to creating an EDA, to churn and modeling.

## Required Packages

The following R packages are required to be installed in order to run the Shiny web application locally.

- [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/): the R framework for web application development
- [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/): used for creating static plots
- [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/): used for creating interactive plots
- [hrbrthemes](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes): themes that are used for the plots made
- [showtext](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/showtext/vignettes/introduction.html): renders fonts properly

## How To Run

Open R console in ./CLV and run:

```R
shiny::runApp()
```

OR start RStudio and click "Run App" in ./CLV/app.R
